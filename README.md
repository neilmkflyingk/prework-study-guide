# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As a student in the UC Berkeley Coding Bootcamp, I want to learn the skills necessary to become a proficient and professional web developer. I built this prework-study-guide as an opportunity to implement the knowledge and skills that I developed while completing the bootcamp prework. This project streamlines the course work and offers users a guide to simply and efficiently complete the bootcamp prework. While completing this project, I learned a great deal of knowledge about the fundamentals and implementation of these fundamentals in areas including HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Usage

Use this study guide to efficiently learn about key terms and ideas. Each section contains notes on these terms and ideas in their respective sections. It can also be used to review and study these topics at any point, seeing as how we are learning an incredible amount of new information all throughout this prework as well as during the bootcamp itself. Open the DevTools console to see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics that we learned about during the prework as well as choose one topic to study first. This guide can also be used as reference material while trying to complete tasks that are covered in the prework. There is an Ordered list in the Git section that I found helpful to refer to each time I needed to complete part of the Git flow while still becoming comfortable with this process.
