        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS pertains to colors, aesthetics, visual layout, land organization</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used to style an element directly in the HTML file. They apply to specific HTML tags.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet goes in the head element. It is used to style multiple elements in the page code.</li>

          <li>A margin indicates how much space we eant around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we eant around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>CSS Rule Breakdown:
            The selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.
            Declarations contain the property we want to apply and the value of the property.
          </li>
          <li>Class Attributes allow us to share a CCSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule tp a class attribute with a class selector. Then the class attribute can be assigned tp the element in the HTML, enabling us to freely choose which elements will be assigned the CSS rule. The . Preceding the selector designates it as a class selector.</li>
